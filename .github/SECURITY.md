## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability in the app please email me at [chouse.samuel@gmail.com](mailto:chouse.samuel@gmail.com) or contact me 
on Discord at Xenfo#0001.

Once a vulnerability is reported, maintainers will investigate and take action on it. If a maintainer cannot 
replicate the vulnerability, the issue will be closed. If the issue is accepted there will be a security patch immediatly or the patch 
will be added to the next version of Maintainer Bot depending on the severity of the vulnerability.
